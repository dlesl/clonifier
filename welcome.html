<h1>Welcome to Clonifier</h1>
<p>With this program you can:
    <ul>
        <li>Browse sequence files, e.g. genomes and plasmid maps</li>
        <li>Simulate PCR</li>
        <li>Simulate DNA assembly methods such as Gibson Assembly</li>
        <li>Work in an aesthetically pleasing environment ;)</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>Because of the questionable design and excessive complexity of this software, you will probably
    need to start by following the step-by-step <a href="info:tutorial.html" title="Tutorial">Tutorial</a>. You can also read the (probably largely redundant) <a href="info:guide.html" title="Guide">Guide</a>.</p>
<p>If anything doesn't work properly, it might be because it doesn't work properly, but it might also be your browser. Since the <i>real</i> reason for Clonifier's existence is to play around with new technologies like WebAssembly, it probably only works in the latest versions of Firefox and Chrome.</p>
