<h1>Guide</h1>
<h2>Basics</h2>
<p>
    On your left you will find two lists which you are able to edit:
    <ul>
        <li>Primers</li>
        <li>Sequences</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>Primers</h3>
<p>
    To add a primer to the list, click the add (‚ûï) button at the bottom of the pane.
</p>
<p>
    When editing the list, you can use <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code> to advance to the next field, and <code>&lt;enter&gt;</code>
    to move down.
</p>
<p>
    If you prefer, you can use the "üóíÔ∏è Bulk edit" function to copy/paste values from a spreadsheet. The data should be
    in the following format:
</p>
<pre>Name   Sequence    Description</pre>
<p>
    Description is optional, and the columns can be separated by any number of spaces or tabs. This means no spaces are
    allowed in the primer name!
</p>
<p>
    After pasting in your primer list, click "üíæ Save".
</p>
<h3>Sequences</h3>
<p>
    The sequences list works in a similar way, except you must first open a file to be able to save it to the list.
    Files in Genbank (<code>.gb</code>, <code>.ape</code>) format are supported. You can open files from your harddrive using File -> Open, or by
    dragging them into the window. If you drag files into the sequence list, they will be saved directly.
</p>
<p>
    Some DNA sequences are available from the drop-down menu under "Standard Templates". The bacterial genomes are
    quite
    large, and may take a few seconds to load. During this time, the status bar in the bottom right of the screen will
    indicate that something is happening in the background.
</p>
<h2>PCR</h2>
<p>
    To simulate PCR, open a sequence, select the primers you want to test, and click "PCR" at the bottom of the primer
    list.
</p>
<p>
    You can adjust the parameters and click "Run" to repeat the PCR with the same primers and template.
</p>
<p>
    You can click on a product to open it as a sequence, or save it directly to the sequences list.
</p>
<h2>Gibson Assembly</h2>
<p>
    To simulate Gibson assembly, select the sequences you wish to assemble, at click "Assemble" at the bottom of the
    sequence list. Clonifier shows you possible circular and linear products. By holding the mouse over an entry, you
    can see a diagram of how the DNA fragments have been assembled. Clicking on an entry opens its sequence.
